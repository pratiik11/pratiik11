# 💫 Hello, World!
 I'm Pratik Patil 👋<br><br>I'm a finance enthusiast, Python aficionado, and aspiring quant, currently based in the beautiful city of Munich, Germany. When I'm not crunching numbers for my master’s degree in finance or preparing for the CFA Level 1 exam, you can find me exploring the exciting world of Python and its applications in finance.<br><br>🎓 About Me<br>Finance is my playground and Python is my swing! I love diving deep into financial markets, portfolio management, and financial analysis. But what really gets me excited is applying this knowledge in real-world scenarios, especially when I get to use Python. <br><br>🛠 Skills<br>- Python (My favorite snake 🐍)<br>- Excel (My magic carpet for data manipulation)<br>- Financial Analysis (My detective lens 🔍)<br>- Portfolio Management (My strategy game 🎲)<br><br>📚 Projects<br>I'm currently working on some exciting finance projects, where I get to play with Python and Excel. It's like building my own financial universe, one cell or script at a time. If you're as passionate about finance as I am and love to collaborate, let's join forces!<br><br>Whether you're confused about finance jargon, looking for some advice, or just want to chat about the latest trends in finance, I'm all ears! Don't hesitate to reach out. <br><br>😄 Fun Fact<br>Finance isn't just about numbers and charts—it's also about understanding the world around us. Every change in the market tells a story, and I love being a part of that narrative. Plus, who said finance can't be fun? Have you ever tried to calculate the present value of a pizza? 🍕<br>
